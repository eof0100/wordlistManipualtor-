<b>Wordlist Manipulator (wm)</b> will take your existing wordlists and perform
desired manipulation techniques. WM will read your existing wordlist one
word per line, letter by letter, converting each character to desired technique.
Currently, some of the techniques available are case options, prefix, append, 
wpa conversion, and wordlist optimization.New techniques are still being added.

In Programming it is discouraged to reinvent the wheel especially if there are many
tools out there like this one that offer more options, higher performance, and updates.
Tools like crunch, wlm, and one of my favorites rsmangler. In this case reinventing
the wheel means that I can learn and understand Python in ways I couldn't just from
reading a book.

<h4>Background</h4>
<p>This is my first small project. I am constantly messing around with my wordlists
using the linux built-in commands such as cat, grep, awk, sort, etc. Began learning 
Python and I thought it would be a perfect practice project plus creating something
that I will actually use on a regular basis. If someone can benefit from it that is
definitely a plus. Go easy on my coding, remember, learning in progress.<br><p>
